# Basic Calculator

A fundamental web based calculator built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling calculations.

## Overview

This project implements a simple yet functional calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for performing quick calculations directly in the web browser. Being built entirely with client-side technologies means it's lightweight and doesn't require any server-side processing.

## Features

- **Standard Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/).
- **Clear Display:** Shows the current input and results in a clear, digital-style display.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Features easily clickable buttons for digits (0-9) and operators.
- **Clear Functionality:** Includes a "C" (Clear) button to reset the display.
- **Equals Button:** Calculates and displays the result when the "=" button is pressed.
- **Responsive Layout:** Currently not responsive. Only works best in desktop or laptop (wide screens).
- **Client-Side Implementation:** Entirely built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fast, in-browser execution.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Defines the structure and elements of the calculator's interface (buttons, display).
- **CSS:** Styles the appearance of the calculator, including button design, layout, and display styling.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the core logic for handling button clicks, performing calculations, and updating the display.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the on-screen buttons to input numbers and operators.
4. Press the "=" button to see the result.
5. Press the "C" button to clear the display.

## Potential Future Enhancements

- Adding support for more advanced operations (e.g., square root, percentages).
- Implementing error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
- Improving the visual design and user experience.
- Incorporating keyboard input support.
